Still, I stubbornly picked it up mainly because it features a podcast element, which sounded super interesting to me—and honestly, that might be the book’s biggest selling point. Following the daily updates in a small-town setting, seeing everyone’s lies and cover-ups unfold, or just being able to “eavesdrop” on the town’s gossip—it’s actually kind of fun.<br/><br/><br/>There is some suspense, but not a lot. And one thing that really bothered me: why didn’t the police catch Lucy five years ago? Surely there must have been an investigation report, right? The book ignores it entirely and relies on the handsome, charming podcaster to start from scratch. Talk about gutsy.<br/><br/>After the book keeps mentioning how gorgeous Ben is, I ended up convincing myself to treat this as a romance with a sprinkle of mystery. As a romance, it’s just okay. There were a few moments that irritated me, but I didn’t care too much about any of the characters anyway. The real surprise was the grandmother—she’s surprisingly wise and grounded!<br/><br/><br/>One fun meta moment: the protagonist has a side hustle writing romance novels under a pen name, with three books already published. She keeps it secret because she thinks no one would want to read romance novels written by a murder suspect. Um… hello? Someone who can write suspense, commit a murder, and evade the police? People would definitely want to read that—at least I would.<br/><br/><br/>Since my expectations were so low, I wasn’t too disappointed in the end. The ending even had a small moment of uplift.<br/><br/><br/>Potential spoilers/triggers:<br/><br/><spoiler> All the main male characters are self-absorbed, yet the protagonist somehow sleeps with them all (even her abusive ex-husband).<br/><br/>Extremely unprofessional behaviour: the investigative podcaster sleeps with a subject, and a psychologist leaks client assessments to the media. </spoiler>",,,1,0

I love being drawn into the author’s carefully constructed mysteries, following the clues, peeling back layers, and piecing together the truth step by step. When a story is tightly plotted and the foreshadowing is clever, that moment when the final piece of the puzzle clicks into place is incredibly satisfying — like playing a brilliant game of chess against the author and finally winning.<br/><br/>Second, it comes from a simple sense of justice. When the villain is punished, the victim is saved, the truth comes out, and the wrongly accused are vindicated — it’s deeply cathartic.<br/><br/>Because of that, I can tolerate some depictions of cruelty and suffering — but only to a point. If the perpetrator doesn’t face consequences, then what’s the point of putting the characters (and readers!) through all that trauma? Am I just supposed to believe it’s the author’s personal kink?<br/><br/>Which brings me back to this book. And honestly… There is zero suspense here.<br/><br/>The premise: the protagonist’s daughter went missing ten years ago. A decade later, she meets a seemingly perfect man, and they start a relationship — only for her to discover that he has a nine-year-old daughter who looks exactly like her missing child.<br/><br/>Now, anyone who can do basic math — and knows that pregnancy takes nine months — can figure out what’s going on almost immediately. I expected some clever twist later on, but… There isn’t one.<br/><br/>So what’s left to read? Watching a little girl being imprisoned, psychologically tortured, and killed? Watching a mentally unstable woman spiral further into madness? Watching a grieving mother drown in endless pain?<br/><br/>And yes, I am calling the abuser “the crazy woman,” because honestly, that’s exactly how she’s written. She desperately needs psychiatric help — probably more than prison time. If her ultimate goal was just to use a child to hold on to a man, surely there were less insane, lower-risk, and more practical ways to achieve that. As an ordinary, rational person, I simply can’t make sense of her actions — nor can I understand why a book like this has become so popular.",true,,1,0

This time, I honestly couldn’t pinpoint the culprit until the very end — I kept wavering, suspecting almost every single named character along the way. That said, because there are so many twists, it did feel a little too deliberate at times — as if the author wanted to shock the reader no matter what, even if it meant turning the “least likely suspect” into the killer.<br/><br/><br/>What really makes this book heavy, though, is its overall tone. Unlike a “popcorn thriller,” this one feels much more grounded and realistic, especially in its nuanced portrayal of relationships and character development — particularly the two leads. The emotional depth is remarkable, sometimes even uncomfortably so.<br/><br/><br/>The events from twenty years ago also carry a lot of weight. In a story like this, I find it too simplistic to label certain characters as purely “bad” — that would make things far too neat and stereotypical. But truly examining their motivations, the pain and trauma behind their choices… that process itself is heartbreaking. And honestly, the lives of the two main characters are quite tragic as well.<br/><br/><br/>From a literary standpoint, this book is definitely a level above your average popcorn thriller. It’s a novel meant to be savoured slowly — provided you’re ready for its darker, heavier undertones.<br/><br/><br/>⚠️ Content Warnings: school bullying, domestic violence, unhealthy sexual relationships, graphic murder scenes, and animal cruelty.",,,1,0

I even started taking notes to keep track of everyone. But as I kept reading, I realised how skilful the author is at character-building — even the side characters are vivid and memorable. More importantly, the main characters are incredibly likable (at least, I loved them!). And because I cared so much about them, whenever one of them was about to walk into danger, I literally jumped up and yelled, “No! Don’t go there!” <br/><br/><br/>Another thing I adored: everyone in this book actually has their brain switched on. Some of them are even smarter than I expected (I’ve suffered through enough thrillers with “IQ-dropping” protagonists…).<br/><br/><br/>And oh, the FBI agent! She’s eight months pregnant with twins, which completely breaks the stereotypical image of FBI agents in fiction. I did notice that a lot of Goodreads reviewers questioned the plausibility of her being so active this late into pregnancy — but hey, the author’s a man, so maybe we can cut him some slack. <br/><br/><br/>The mystery plot itself is also excellent. I did manage to guess the culprit relatively early, but the twists and turns along the way still managed to surprise me in the best possible way.",,,1,0
